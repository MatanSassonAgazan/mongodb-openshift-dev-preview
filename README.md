mongodb-openshift-dev-preview
=============================

This is the MongoDB Enterprise Openshift "Developer Preview"!
The contents of this repository demonstrate functional integration
between the Red Hat Openshift PaaS and MongoDB Enterprise.
You can now spin up MongoDB Enterprise replica sets within
your own OpenShift environment.

DISCLAIMER: This repository is for demonstration purposes only.
No assumptions should be made between this particular implementation
and future support products of MongoDB, Inc. Do not use in anything
close to a production environment. All support, as it is, takes
a standard open-source model. Anyone interested can contribute 
through GitHub.
